We are working on a webapp for world of warcraft crassic. this webapp would be for finding the best in slot item for your character.

The design should be modern but matching with the fantasy theme of World of Warcraft.

What the site needs to do:
- user selects class,
- user can select current item of his character for each slot (the item search must have the best ux practises for this purpose,
- then the app will suggest the next best in slot item for each slot and where to get them.
